## ✨ What is Sync-in?

**Sync-in** is a **secure**, **open-source platform** for file sharing, synchronization, and collaboration — built to
give **individuals and organizations full control** over their data.  
It lets you **host your own workspace**, where you can **organize, access, and collaborate** on **files, notes, and
documents** with your team, your friends, or just for yourself.

It offers:

- 🔐 **Data sovereignty**: Your files stay on your infrastructure — no third-party cloud, full control.
- 🛡️ **Privacy-first design**: No tracking, no telemetry. What you store is yours, and stays private.
- ⚙️ **Granular permission system**: Manage user and group access with space-level and file-level controls.
- 🔄 **Synchronization**: Keep files synced across devices with native desktop clients (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- 📄 **Collaborative editing**: Work on documents together in real time with OnlyOffice integration.
- 🗂️ **Spaces**: Organize your content into secure, shareable spaces — personal, team, or public.
- 👥 **Secure sharing**: Share files and folders with specific users or groups, with full access control
- 🔗 **Public link sharing**: Generate secure, time-limited public links to share content easily with anyone.
- 🔍 **Server-side full-text indexing**: Quickly find content across all your documents (self-hosted & private).
- 📊 **Activity history & notifications**: Keep track of changes and team activity.
- 📦 **Built-in WebDAV support**: Mount your Sync-in spaces as remote drives.
- 🌐 **Universal access**: Use Sync-in from any browser, or via mobile & desktop apps.
